# Superstore and Food Forecasting Data Analysis with Tableau
This GitHub repository contains a Tableau file that showcases my analysis of a Superstore franchise and food forecasting for a meal delivery company that operates in multiple cities. Through this project, I have utilized my Tableau skills to manipulate, wrangle, and visualize a dataset that covers features such as product name, categories, regions, cities, and a whole host of other variables.

## Repository Contents
This repository includes a Tableau file along with the dataset that contains various data visualizations and dashboards that are interactive and user-friendly. The Tableau file also includes business stories and analysis of the historical demand for a product-centre combination, product features such as category, sub-category, current price, and discount, as well as information for fulfilment centres like centre area, city information, etc.

## Usage
To use the Tableau file, simply download or clone the repository and open the Tableau file in your Tableau Desktop application. From there, you can manipulate the data and visualizations to suit your analysis needs.
